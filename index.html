        <a name="aboutThisService"><h2>About This Service</h2></a>
        <p>
          HM Land Registry's Digital Mortgage service consists of 2 linked services:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create and Manage Mortgage Deeds - for conveyancers.</li>
          <li>Sign Your Mortgage Deed - for borrowers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Create and Manage Mortgage Deeds allows a conveyancer to create a
          digital mortgage using the interface provided by Deed-API. The
          service also provides endpoints for getting a created deed, checking
          which deeds have been signed by borrowers, and making a deed effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deeds created using the Deed-API service can be signed by a borrower
          using the Sign Your Mortgage service on GOV.UK and submitted to
          HM Land Registry for registration using Business Gateway.
        </p>

        <h4>Organisation-API</h4>
        <p>
          As well as the above Deed-API endpoints, the service also provides an endpoint
          for returning a list of organisation names via Organisation-API.
        </p>

          <a name="identityChecks"><h2>Identity Checks</h2></a>
          <p>
            Under section 111 of the Network Access Agreement HM Land Registry requests conveyancers to confirm
            that the borrowers identity has been established.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the business model of your organisation there are two methods you can use to confirm that
            due diligence has been performed and the borrowers identity has been established.
          <p>
          <h3>If the checks will be performed by your organisation when creating a deed</h3>
          <p>
            If the borrowers identity will be established by your organisation on create deed you can confirm to
            HM Land Registry that the checks have been performed by setting the identity_checked value in the create
            deed payload to "Y".
          </p>
          <p>For more information refer to the create deed entry in the
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LandRegistry/sign-your-mortgage-documentation/gh-pages/schema.yaml">
            schema
          </a>.
        </p>
        <h3>If the checks will be performed by a different organisation than the one that created the deed</h3>
        <p>
          If the checks will be carried out by a different organisation than the one creating the deed then on deed
          creation the identity_checks value should be set to "N".
        </p>
        <p>
          The organisation carrying out the checks will be able to perform the identity checks by calling the
          /identity-checks endpoint on the system and providing the name address, ID and date of birth for each borrower.
        </p>
        <p>
          The identity-checked endpoint is documented in the
          <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LandRegistry/sign-your-mortgage-documentation/gh-pages/schema.yaml">
            schema
          </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>*NOTE*</b> The borrowers will not be able to sign the deed until the identity checks have been successfully
          carried out either on creation or by using the identity-checked endpoint.
        </p>
        <p><b>BY DOING EITHER OF THE STEPS ABOVE YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT DUE DILIGENCE HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AND
          THE BORROWERS IDENTITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.</b>

        <div class="schemas">
          <a name="intermediary"><h2>Using This Service as an Intermediary</h2></a>
          <p>
            If you are acting as an intermediary and you will not be the organisation completing the deed then there
            are additional steps you will need to perform.
          </p>
          <p>
            When creating a deed you will need to set the name of the proxy organisation you intend to assign the deed
            to.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this you will need to set the "proxy_organisation_name" field in the create deed payload to the name
            of the organisation you wish to designate as a proxy. Doing this will then allow the proxy conveyancer to
            also access the deed and perform identity checks.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get an up to date list of the availible organisations in the service that can be used as a proxy, you
            can call the get the organisations endpoint in the service that will return an up to date list of all valid
            organisations.
          </p>
          <p>
            When creating a deed you must provide one of these values in the create deed schema exactly
            in the format it is provided by the organisations endpoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more information on consuming the organisations functionality see the schema file for this endpoint

              here
            </a>.
          </p>
            <p>
              <b>*NOTE*</b> If you set a value in the "proxy_organisation_name" field then only this organisation will
              be able to make the deed effective.

          <p>
            HM Land Registry operates a Test Hub which runs a test version of
            the Deed-API service, allowing developers to test their solution
            against a running example of the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to the Test Hub is controlled via WebSEAL and you will need
            to request to have your organisation's certificate added to the
            access list.
          </p>
          <p>The URL's for the Test Hub are as follows:</p>

            There are a selection of test Titles and MD references in the Test
            Hub which can be used to test the service. Note that when creating
            a deed the borrowers must be an exact match to the proprietors on
            the register. See example payload above for a create deed payload
            using the data below that will work in the Test Hub. Some example
            test data is below. For a full list click

            Once a digital mortgage has been signed and made effective applying
            to have it registered is done using the existing EDRS channel through
            HM Land Registry's Business Gateway Portal.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more information on how to develop for Business Gateway please find the
            developer documentation here
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/business-gateway-developer-pack">Business Gateway Developer Pack</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            To submit a digital mortgage follow the steps outlined in the Business Gateway documentation
             to lodge an Application and add a certified document to follow to the application as shown below:
          </p>

             <code>
&lt;Document&gt;</br>
&emsp;&lt;CertifiedCopy&gt;Certified&lt;/CertifiedCopy&gt;</br>
&lt;/Document&gt;</br>
             </code>

          <br />

          <p>
            However once this application has been lodged <strong>do not</strong> submit a request to lodge the
            charge document - Business Gateway will detect that this is a Digital Mortgage and do this for you automatically.
